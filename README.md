A simple To-do List app, with features to add each project. And within each projects are corresponding tasks that can be checked, set the due date and set priority. All-task Button can be used to view all the tasks available across all projects, and Today button can be pressed to view the task for the current date. Data are stored in Local Storage. 

This project is part of the Odin Project Curricullum. By working on this app, I've learned to implement Object Oriented Programming by assigning a class object to my Project Object and Task Object.
